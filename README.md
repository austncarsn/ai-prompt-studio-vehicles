AI Vehicle Prompt Studio is a lightweight, interactive web application designed for creative technologists and AI enthusiasts to generate cinematic prompts for video AI tools like Sora or similar models. Specializing in automotive scenes, it allows users to configure car details, environments, camera angles, and visual effects to craft hyper-detailed, production-ready prompts. Built as a single HTML file, it's perfect for rapid prototyping, content creation, and workflow integration in digital ateliers.

## About the Project

In the world of AI-driven video generation, crafting the perfect prompt can turn a simple idea into a blockbuster scene. AI Vehicle Prompt Studio streamlines this process for automotive-focused creators, blending structure with creative mischief. Whether you're visualizing a Porsche tearing through a cyberpunk city or a Tesla gliding under golden hour light, this tool generates varied, optimized prompts that emphasize physics, aesthetics, and cinematic flair—avoiding repetition for fresh outputs every time.

This project was born from a passion for AI prompt engineering, vector graphics, and Texas-inspired design aesthetics, ensuring a smooth, performant experience with hardware-accelerated animations and glassmorphism UI elements.

### Why Use This?

- **Efficiency**: No installations— just open and create.
- **Customization**: Tailor prompts to specific cars, scenes, and styles without starting from scratch.
- **Portability**: Single-file deployment for easy sharing or embedding in workflows.
- **Inspiration**: Randomize configurations for serendipitous ideas, ideal for hyper-focused creative sessions.
